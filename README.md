# DAOFetcher

DAOFetcher is a platform for users to easily receive updates and learn about a given DAO's culture.

## Smart contracts

All contracts are deployed to the following chains:

[Polygon](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xC51488FC5fD890a110282cB8a6Faf947A5caCD6E#code)
[Optimism](https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xAa11bE646F0725B61c2d5595245Db94b3F6698C6#code)
Scroll
Mantle
Gnosis Chain

DAOFetcher is an intelligent platform tool that allows users to quickly read summaries and access select token-gated content in order to orient and get a sense of a given DAO's culture. By combining our self-written and deployed EVM smart contracts (Polygon, Mantle, and more), aggregation features, and OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, we offer users unique insights into the world of DAOs and what they offer in seconds.
