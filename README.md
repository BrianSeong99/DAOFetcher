# DAOFetcher

*Built for the [Scaling Ethereum](https://ethglobal.com/events/scaling2023) hackathon*

DAOFetcher is a platform for users to easily receive updates and learn about a given DAO's culture.

DAOFetcher is an intelligent platform tool that allows users to quickly read summaries and access select token-gated content in order to orient and get a sense of a given DAO's culture. By combining our self-written and deployed EVM smart contracts (Polygon, Mantle, and more), aggregation features, and OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, we offer users unique insights into the world of DAOs and what they offer in seconds.

## Motivation

A few of our team members have extensive experience running large DAOs. One thing they noticed was that understanding a given DAO and keeping up with all their updates becomes extremely unwieldly as people join more Discord servers. We wanted to solve the fundamental question:

How can we improve DAO accessibility?

1. People are disoriented when they first join a DAO Discord server and are really overwhelmed with the large amounts of information thrown at them.
2. Not everybody wants to (or have the means to) buy the standard NFT membership first to join and get to be a part of a given DAO's community. We wanted to offer a cheaper or lighter access solution for the community to get to know the DAO first before they make their purchase decision.
3. Not everyone has the same on-chain access to DAO communities (some might only have a chain gas token that is not native to the original DAO communityâ€™s membership NFT).

## Smart contracts

All contracts are deployed to the following chains:

- [Polygon](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xC51488FC5fD890a110282cB8a6Faf947A5caCD6E#code)
- [Optimism](https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xAa11bE646F0725B61c2d5595245Db94b3F6698C6#code)
- Scroll
- Mantle
- Gnosis Chain
